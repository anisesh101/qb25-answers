#In README.md, answer: 1. What is the “size” (i.e., slope) of this relationship? Interpret the slope in plain language. Does it match your plot? 2. Is the relationship significant? How do you know? Explain the p-value in plain but precise language.

## For every year a mother ages the number of maternal DNMs increases by approximately 0.38 on average.
## This suggests a positive linear relationship where older mothers tend to pass on slightly more DNMs to their children.
## The p-value is much smaller than 0.05, meaning we can reject the null hypothesis.

## For every additional year of paternal age thenumber of paternal DNMs increases by 1.35 on average. 
## This matches the scatter plot, which shows a strong upward trend. 
## The relationship is highly significant with a p-value less than 2e-16, indicating strong evidence that paternal age affects DNM count.

##(Intercept) 
## 78.7 estimated DNMs for a 50.5 year old man.

#EXERCISE 2.6
## fathers contribute significantly more de novo mutations (DNMs) than mothers. On average, the difference is about 39 additional DNMs per child from the father, and this difference is highly statistically significant
