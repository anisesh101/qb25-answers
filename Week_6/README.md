## What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?
### PC1, specifically, might represent technical/batch differences 
### rather than true biological variation among tissues.

## What feature explains the first principal component (simply saying “tissue” is not sufficient)?
### PC1 separates samples primarily by technical replicate identity, not tissue  

# 3
## For midgut RNA seq samples, cluster 3 is irrelevant because 
## it reflects ovarian/egg processes, not gut function. Cluster 10 
## is more related, as carbohydrate and mannose metabolism could relate to 
## midgut function, though blood pressure related terms are meaningless.
