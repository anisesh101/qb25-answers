## What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?
### The PCA shows strong separation of samples by gut region, 
### suggesting clear regional transcriptional identities and good data 
### quality aside from the mislabeled sample.

## What feature explains the first principal component (simply saying “tissue” is not sufficient)?
### PC1 reflects the proximal-to-distal anatomical axis of the midgut, 
### capturing major functional and physiological differences between 
### anterior and posterior gut regions.

# 3
## For midgut RNA seq samples, cluster 3 is irrelevant because 
## it reflects ovarian/egg processes, not gut function. Cluster 10 
## is more related, as carbohydrate and mannose metabolism could relate to 
## midgut function, though blood pressure related terms are meaningless.
